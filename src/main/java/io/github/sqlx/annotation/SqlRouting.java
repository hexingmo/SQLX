/**
 * The {@code SqlRouting} annotation is used to specify routing information
 * for SQL operations in a distributed database environment. It can be
 * applied to methods to dictate how SQL queries should be directed
 * to specific database clusters and nodes.
 *
 * <p>Attributes:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code cluster}: (default is an empty string) Specifies the
 *       name of the database cluster to which the SQL operation
 *       should be routed.</li>
 *   <li>{@code nodes}: (default is an empty array) An array of node
 *       identifiers that indicates specific database nodes within
 *       the cluster to route the SQL operation to.</li>
 *   <li>{@code propagation}: (default is true) Indicates whether
 *       the routing behavior should propagate to any nested SQL
 *       operations or transactions.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This annotation is retained at runtime, allowing for dynamic
 * routing decisions based on the specified parameters.</p>
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @SqlRouting(cluster = "user-db", nodes = {"node1", "node2"}, propagation = true)
 * public void performDatabaseOperation() {
 *     // Implementation of the database operation
 * }
 * Note: Proper usage of this annotation can enhance performance and reliability in applications
 * that rely on multiple database clusters and nodes.
